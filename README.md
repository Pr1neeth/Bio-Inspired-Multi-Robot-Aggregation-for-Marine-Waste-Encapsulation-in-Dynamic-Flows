# Bio-Inspired-Multi-Robot-Aggregation-for-Marine-Waste-Encapsulation-in-Dynamic-Flows
This project explores Dynamic Encapsulation, a collaborative multi-robot behavior in which a team of robots learns to locate, surround, and track drifting targets. We apply this behavior to a real-world environmental challenge: protecting marine ecosystems from ocean plastic pollution
While single-robot systems struggle with limited coverage and poor fault tolerance, a multi-robot system (MRS) provides the scalability and robustness needed to monitor large ocean regions. In this work, a learning-based MRS is trained to:

1. Detect and navigate toward floating debris patches
2. Form a stable circular “encapsulation” around the debris
3. Maintain the formation as the patch drifts over time

The goal is to create a robotic “shield” that protects marine life from hazardous debris until cleanup efforts can safely remove it.
