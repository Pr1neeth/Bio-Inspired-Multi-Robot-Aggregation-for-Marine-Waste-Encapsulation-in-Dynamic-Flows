# Bio-Inspired-Multi-Robot-Aggregation-for-Marine-Waste-Encapsulation-in-Dynamic-Flows
This project explores Dynamic Encapsulation, a collaborative multi-robot behavior in which a team of robots learns to locate, surround, and track drifting targets. We apply this behavior to a real-world environmental challenge: protecting marine ecosystems from ocean plastic pollution
